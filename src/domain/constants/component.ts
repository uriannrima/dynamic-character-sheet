The divine focus for a druid or a ranger is a sprig of holly, or some other sacred plant. If the Components line includes F/ DF or M/ DF, the arcane version of the spell has a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component (the abbreviation after the slash).'
